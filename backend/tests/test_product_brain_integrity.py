"""CI guard: docs/PRODUCT-BRAIN.md must retain its authoritative ruling sections.

PRODUCT-BRAIN.md is the standing JUDGMENT layer. Twice it has regressed: a
wholesale rewrite dropped ruling sections that were only ever restored in the
working tree and never banked in git, so the rewrite won by default. This test
turns master RED the instant any of the CI-guarded ruling markers disappears,
making an overwrite impossible to merge silently.

Append-only guidance alone failed twice. This is the enforcement.

If you are INTENTIONALLY removing/renaming a ruling section, that requires an
explicit Alex ruling — update the marker list below IN THE SAME CHANGE and say
so in the commit message. Do not delete a marker to make the test pass.

# ruling sections. Pinning only the four markers above would let a rewrite drop
# ANY OTHER load-bearing section undetected. So we also pin every standing
# ruling / judgment section header. Dash-free substrings are used where possible
# so an em-dash encoding difference cannot cause a false failure.

# master worktree had BOTH accreted two rulings the other lacked (this tree:
# mover headlines + post-deploy rail invocation; master, unpushed: per-WINDOW
# lane ownership + the Invariant-2 amendment). Four load-bearing rulings, none
# of them guarded, one merge away from being dropped silently by whichever side
# won a conflict — which is precisely the failure mode this file exists for, and
